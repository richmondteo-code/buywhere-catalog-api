Usage:
    export BUYWHERE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://buywhere:buywhere@db:5432/catalog
    python scripts/seed_comparison_pages_final.py

This script:
1. Archives 3 existing dev seed pages by setting status='archived'
2. Seeds 4 final published comparison pages (or flags if content missing)

  - nintendo-switch-2     (electronics)
  - dyson-v12-detect-slim  (home)
  - xiaomi-robot-vacuum-s10-plus  (home)
  - blackmores-fish-oil-1000mg-400cap  (health)
