# BuyWhere vs BigCommerce — E-Commerce Platform Compared

Comparing BuyWhere and BigCommerce for developers building e-commerce experiences.

---

## Overview

**BuyWhere** is a product catalog API and MCP server that provides structured, real-time product pricing and availability data across 500+ retailers. Built for developers who need verified cross-merchant commerce data for AI agents, price comparison tools, and deal aggregators.

**BigCommerce** is a SaaS e-commerce platform that powers tens of thousands of online stores. It provides a full cart, checkout, and order management with native B2B features, headless commerce via APIs, and multi-channel selling — without the complexity of enterprise platforms.

---

## Key Differences

| Capability | BuyWhere | BigCommerce |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Core focus** | Cross-merchant price data | SaaS e-commerce platform |
| **Primary data** | Real-time pricing, availability, ratings | Your own product catalogue |
| **Price comparison** | Yes — cross-merchant, real-time | No |
| **MCP server** | Yes — @buywhere/mcp-server | No |
| **AI agent native** | Yes | No |
| **Developer API** | Yes — REST API | Yes — BigCommerce REST API |
| **Use case** | Price data, deal discovery | Build and run an online store |
| **Free tier** | 1,000 calls/month | 14-day free trial |

---

## How They Work Together

BigCommerce merchants can use BuyWhere to add cross-merchant price intelligence:

1. **Product page** — BigCommerce renders your product catalogue with native themes or headless storefront
2. **Price comparison widget** — BuyWhere API shows prices from Amazon, Walmart, and other retailers
3. **AI agent** — Customers use BuyWhere MCP to ask "is this the best price?"
4. **Conversion** — Cross-merchant price context builds purchase confidence

BuyWhere fills the **cross-merchant pricing gap** that a BigCommerce store's catalogue doesn't cover.

## When to Choose BuyWhere

Choose BuyWhere when you need:

- **Cross-merchant price comparison** — real-time prices across Amazon, Walmart, Shopee, Lazada, and 500+ retailers
- **AI agent integration** via MCP for Claude Desktop, Cursor, or custom agents
- **Verified commerce data** from direct merchant feeds — stable, real-time
- **Deal discovery** — find products with active discounts across all retailers
- **Developer-first setup** — API key in minutes, comprehensive documentation
- **Free tier** — 1,000 calls/month without a credit card

---

## When to Choose BigCommerce

Choose BigCommerce when you need:

- **SaaS simplicity** — no server management, automatic updates, and scaling
- **Native B2B features** — company accounts, custom pricing, quote requests, net terms
- **Headless commerce** — APIs for custom frontends (React, Next.js, Vue) with BigCommerce backend
- **Multi-channel selling** — Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping
- **Multi-currency** — sell globally with automatic currency conversion
- **Open SaaS** — no hidden plugin fees, use any frontend with the GraphQL Storefront API
- **BigCommerce API** — REST and GraphQL for products, orders, and storefronts

BigCommerce is built for merchants who want a capable platform without enterprise complexity. It doesn't provide cross-merchant pricing data.

## Technical Comparison

### Data Model

BuyWhere returns verified cross-merchant product data:

```json
{
  "id": "bw_us_12345",
  "name": "Dyson V15 Detect",
  "price": 749.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "merchant": "amazon_us",
  "domain": "amazon.com",
  "in_stock": true,
  "rating": 4.8
}
```

BigCommerce manages your own product catalogue via REST/GraphQL API — it doesn't aggregate pricing from external retailers.

### Integration Approach

BuyWhere — call the REST API or use the MCP server:

```bash
curl https://api.buywhere.ai/v1/products/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYWHERE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "Dyson V15", "country": "US"}'
```

BigCommerce — use the REST API:

```bash
curl 'https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/catalog/products' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: {token}'
```

### Use Case Fit

| Use case | BuyWhere | BigCommerce |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Price comparison app | Yes | No |
| AI shopping agent | Yes | No |
| Deal discovery | Yes | No |
| B2B e-commerce | No | Yes |
| Headless commerce | No | Yes |
| Price comparison for your products | Yes (via BuyWhere API) | No |

## Summary

BuyWhere and BigCommerce serve different purposes. BuyWhere provides **cross-merchant price intelligence** — verified real-time pricing across 500+ retailers — for AI agents, price comparison tools, and deal aggregators. BigCommerce provides **SaaS e-commerce infrastructure** — a capable platform with native B2B features and headless commerce APIs for custom frontends.

Use **BuyWhere alone** when your primary need is price data for AI agents, comparison tools, or deal discovery.

Use **BigCommerce** when you want a SaaS e-commerce platform with B2B capabilities and headless flexibility.

Use **both** if you're a BigCommerce merchant who wants to differentiate with cross-merchant price comparisons — showing customers competitive pricing builds trust and drives conversions.
