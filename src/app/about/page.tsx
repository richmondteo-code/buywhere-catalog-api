            <p className="text-indigo-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              AI agents can reason about what to buy. They struggle to know what exists, what it costs, or where to find it.

          </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Problem</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Every retailer in Singapore has its own API, its own schema, and its own access requirements — if it has a public API at all. The major platforms (Shopee, Lazada) do have APIs, but those APIs surface their own inventory first. A Lazada API call returns Lazada products. A Shopee API call returns Shopee products. For an AI agent trying to find the best match for a user across the market, that is not a catalog — it is a sales channel.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              For developers, that means writing and maintaining integrations for every retailer you want to cover, reconciling incompatible schemas, handling auth rotation, and absorbing breakage when retailers change their APIs. Most teams do not do this. They narrow scope, limit coverage, or build on top of search results and hope the data is good enough.

                BuyWhere is a single, neutral product catalog API for Singapore commerce.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                One API key. One schema. Products from across the market, not just from one platform. Structured metadata — title, price, availability, specs, category, affiliate link — returned in a consistent format that your agent can reason against without preprocessing.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                BuyWhere monetises through referral fees, merchant partnerships, and demand routing — not API subscription fees. When AI agents match buyers with products through our catalog, we participate in the commerce economics of that transaction.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Shopee and Lazada are incentivised to surface their own sellers. That is rational for them. It is a problem for you if you are trying to build a product that answers &ldquo;what is the best option across the market?&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              BuyWhere has no inventory to sell and no platform to favour. We index products from independent Singapore merchants and consumer electronics retailers alongside the major platforms. When your agent calls BuyWhere, it gets the market — not a platform&rsquo;s interpretation of it.
