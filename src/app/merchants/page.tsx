              AI is changing how consumers find and buy products. BuyWhere makes your catalog
              discoverable to the AI agents and shopping assistants that are driving this shift —
              starting with Singapore.

            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              AI shopping assistants and product-comparison agents are the fastest-growing channel for product discovery.
              These agents don&rsquo;t browse storefronts — they query structured data. If your catalog isn&rsquo;t in
              the data layer they search, your products don&rsquo;t exist to them.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              BuyWhere is that data layer. We are building the neutral product catalog that AI agents in Singapore
              query to find, compare, and recommend products. Listing your catalog here means your products are
              discoverable every time an agent searches for what you sell.
